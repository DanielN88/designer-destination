# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
# orbs:
#   node: circleci/node@4.7
#   cypress: cypress-io/cypress@2.0.0

# Invoke jobs via workflows
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
# workflows:
#   sample: # This is the name of the workflow, feel free to change it to better match your workflow.
    # Inside the workflow, you define the jobs you want to run.
